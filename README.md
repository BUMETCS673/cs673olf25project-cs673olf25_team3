## Project Setup and Run Guide

### System Requirements

This project requires the following to run properly:

- **Python:** version 3.10 or higher

### Backend Development 

The backend is built using the Django framework. 

**Backend structure:**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                # the core django framework
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asgi.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ urls.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wsgi.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                # the api application
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ views.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requriements.txt    # dependency packages
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .venv/


```

#### Setting Up The Backend 
All backend development should be done in the `backend/` directory. To setup the backend:

1. Create a python virtual environment in the backend directory

```
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the `venv`

```
# for macOS or Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# for Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note:* 

When installing new packages, update the `requirements.txt` with the following:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

4.  Update the database table

```
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Running the Backend

To run the backend locally

```
python manage.py runserver
```
